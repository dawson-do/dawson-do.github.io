I spend a lot of time doing puzzlehunts. These types of puzzles are hard to define, but a common thread is that they don't come with clear instructions. You are presented *something* and need to figure out how to solve it, typically resulting in an English word or phrase. [This post][puzzle-intro] gives a much better introduction than I can.

Here are my [puzzle-related blog posts](/blog/puzzle).

During undergraduate, I wrote puzzles for the University of Maryland’s Puzzle Club. I became the project lead starting Fall 2019.

Here's a selected list of puzzles that I have written and/or contributed to. If you are attempting any, feel free to ask me for hints.

In addition to writing puzzles, I served as the lead editor and contributed ideas to several others. I was also responsible for a majority of website operations for this project,  so I encourage you to look at the whole project.
