Puzzlehunts are one of my main hobbies. These types of puzzles are hard to define, but a common thread is that they don't come with clear instructions. You are presented *something* and need to figure out how to solve it, typically resulting in an English word or phrase. [This post][puzzle-intro] gives a much better introduction than I can.

Here's a list of my puzzle-related blog posts:

* Bloomberg Bpuzzled [Part 1][bpuzzled-1] & [Part 2][bpuzzled-2]

During undergraduate, I wrote puzzles for the University of Maryland’s Puzzle Club. I became the project lead starting Fall 2019.

Here's a selected list of puzzles that I have written and/or contributed to. If you are attempting any, feel free to ask me for hints.

In addition to writing puzzles, I served as the lead editor and contributed ideas to several others (listed with an asterisk). I was also responsible for a majority of website operations for this project,  so I encourage you to look at the whole project.
