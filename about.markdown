<<<<<<< HEAD
I am currently pursuing a PhD in Transportation Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. My research focuses on macroscopic traffic flow models using 2D partial differential equations. I also explore numerical methods to solve these models. I completed a Master's of Science in Transportation Engineering in 2021, also at Berkeley. Before that, I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a double degree: an MS in Mathematics and an MS in Civil & Environmental Engineering.

My main hobby is doing puzzlehunts. I have also authored and written about [puzzlehunts](/puzzles/). Other than that, I enjoy cooking and food science, listening to (mainly) pop music, and watching reality tv. 

#### Contact

The best way to contact me is by email `(the first four letters of my first name---all lowercase)@berkeley.edu`. If you prefer, I also use Discord `DAWS#1200`, but you should let me know if you have sent me a friend request.
