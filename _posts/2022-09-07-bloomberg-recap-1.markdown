In 2019, I was still pretty new to puzzle hunts and wouldn't really call myself competitive---the only online competitions I had done were Puzzle Potluck 2 and MUMS 2019[^1]. However, I did do some localized hunts like DASH, DCPHR, and Microsoft College Puzzle Challenge (CPC) in 2018. CPC was the highlight of my freshman year at UMD. After getting fourth within UMD, I became obsessed with puzzles. I couldn't wait to challenge the spot for first at UMD and see how I stacked up against other college teams. The prospect of competing against other college students was more exciting to me than other events, since I felt the pool of teams was more relatable, experience-wise. When Microsoft CPC 2019 was cancelled, it left this niche completely empty.

Luckily, Bloomberg decided to get into running puzzle hunts aimed for college students the next school year, calling their events Bpuzzled. Unlike CPC, Bpuzzled consists of two events. The first Bpuzzled is local, held at each institution at various dates throughout the year. The first place team at each university wins an expenses-paid trip to New York City and gets to compete at the Bpuzzled Finals held at Bloomberg's Midtown Manhattan office[^2].
