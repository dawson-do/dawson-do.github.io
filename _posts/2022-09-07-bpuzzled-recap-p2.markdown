In [Part 1][part-1], I wrote about what Bpuzzled even is and my experience the first year it was hosted.
## Nov 13: Bpuzzled UMD
The pandemic happened, so I wasn't hopeful that I would win another trip to New York, but was nonetheless excited when I learned Bpuzzled would still happen. After doing tons of puzzle hunts from that spring until fall, I felt way more confident than before. Duck Gizzards started doing pretty well in online hunts, so during my final year at UMD, I expected to have a shot at taking first at Bpuzzled.

This year, Josh and Steven returned as team members, while Grant (another UMD Puzzlehunt writer and regular hunt teammate) took Ryan's spot, since he graduated. This year the format was the same: you initially start with three puzzles and unlock one more for every solve. The answer checker confirms partials (and more), and you are given canned hints every 10 minutes after the puzzle is unlocked. There would be eight puzzles and a metapuzzle that you would have to solve in the 3-hour time limit.
### Puzzles
Steven and I got to work on Step by Steppe, which was a simple criss-cross puzzle where each entry was a pair of homophones. On this puzzle I used the answer checker a lot to confirm my entries. Josh completed Dance Like an Egyptian, a puzzle visually cluing famous dances, like YMCA and the Moonwalk. Grant got started on Rogue Gallery, where he figured out the mashed up the names of paintings and Batman villains. I joined him, helping ID the villains, but got stuck on the extraction, so we moved on to another puzzle, waiting for the canned hints to come along.

I started to work on Spill the Tea with Grant while Josh and Steven worked on Textris. Spill the Tea clued the names of Drag Queens using some descriptions written like they were for tea. After completing Spill the Tea and Textris, we unlocked Mirror Mishap and Grinding Your Teeth. Grant already started working on Mirror Mishap, so I started working on the other puzzle.

Some time while I was working on Grinding Your Teeth, my teammates solved Mirror Mishap and we unlocked the metapuzzle. I dropped my puzzle---I could already tell it'd take too long---and went to look at the meta. The puzzle gave you grid which was a key for a pigpen-like cipher (clearly inspired by pigpen, but it was their own custom code). Each answer was seven letters long, and the presentation suggested that the letters at each index were assigned a color from ROYGBIV. Then you needed to color in the given grid of letters and decode the shapes using their cipher. We didn't take too long to figure out the meta, but with two missing answers, it took us some time fiddling around to get the answer to fall out. With the solve in about 2 hours, we punched our ticket to the virtual Bpuzzled finals.
## Feb 26: Bpuzzled Finals
The Nintendo Switch is currently collecting dust as a bookend---before, I spent pretty significant amounts of time playing Pokémon Mystery Dungeon DX and Pokémon Snap.
