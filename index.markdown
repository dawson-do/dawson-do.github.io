### Hey, Dawson here.

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Transportation Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. My research focuses on 2D traffic flow models based on partial differential equations. I also like to study the numerical methods used to solve these models. I completed a Master's of Science in Transportation Engineering in 2021, also at Berkeley. Before that, I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a double degree: an BS in Mathematics and an BS in Civil & Environmental Engineering.

Hereâ€™s my [CV](/dawsonDo_CV_grad.pdf).

### Hobbies

My main hobby is doing puzzlehunts, which are competitions where teams try to solve puzzles. I have also authored and written about [puzzlehunts](/puzzles/). Most notably, I was the project lead for several iterations of the [UMD Puzzlehunt](https://2021.umdpuzzle.club/) (2019-2021). Beyond that, I like to spend my time learning about food science and listening to (mainly pop) music.

### Contact

The best way to contact me is by email at (the first four letters of my first name)`@berkeley.edu`.

I also frequently check Discord (`@DAWS#1200`), but let me know if you have sent me a friend request. With less reliability, you can reach me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/umdpuzzle) or [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/dawsondo) shoutbox.
