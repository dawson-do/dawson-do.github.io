title: Hey, Dawson here.
---
I'm currently a PhD student in Transportation Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. My research focuses on large-scale traffic forecasting models based on partial differential equations. I specifically like to study the numerical methods used to solve these models. I also work at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) with the AI group within the Computational Science Center. My work at NREL focuses on grid controls during extreme climate events. Read more about my research [here](/projects/).

In 2022, I completed a Master's of Science in Transportation Engineering, also at Berkeley. Before that, I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a double degree: a BS in Mathematics and a BS in Civil & Environmental Engineering. Go Terps!

Hereâ€™s my [CV](assets/dawsonDo_CV_grad.pdf).

### Hobbies

My main hobby is doing puzzlehunts, which are competitions where teams try to solve puzzles. I have also authored and written about [puzzlehunts](/puzzles/). Most notably, I was the project lead for several iterations of the [UMD Puzzlehunt](https://2021.umdpuzzle.club/) (2019-2021). Beyond that, I like to spend my time learning about food science and listening to (mainly pop) music.

### Contact

The best way to contact me is by email at (the first four letters of my first name) `@berkeley.edu`.

I also frequently check Discord (`@daws_`), but let me know if you have sent me a friend request. With less reliability, you can reach me via [ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/people/ddaws/) or [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/dawsondo) shoutbox.
