### Macroscopic Traffic Flow Models

#####  Two-Dimensional Diffusive and Advective Traffic Model on Large Networks

Poster at *Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting, 2023*

### Traffic Signal Optimization

##### Concurrent Optimization of Cycle Length, Green Splits, and Offsets for the Diverging Diamond Interchange

Published in [*Transportation Research Record, 2022*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/03611981221096664).

Under the mentorship of Dr. Gang-Len Chang at the University of Maryland, College Park, I developed a method for optimizing signal control and coordination for an unconventional interchange. To validate the proposed Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model, I designed experiments using the Vissim traffic simulator.
