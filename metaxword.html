<h1>A Beginner’s Guide to Constructing a Meta-Crossword</h1>
<p style="font-size:80%;"><i>This post is written for a university assignment. It may not be kept up-to-date.</i></p>
<h3>What is a crossword?</h3>
<p>
First let’s drop the word “meta.” A <strong>crossword</strong> is a puzzle with the goal of filling a <strong>grid</strong> with letters which will form words and phrases when read across or down. These Across and Down entries are filled by solving crossword <strong>clues</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossword">Wikipedia article</a> provides a pretty comprehensive discussion of variations, but this post will focus on the conventions of a standard American-style grid.
</p>
<p>
The two components of a crossword are the grid and the clues. Typical American-style crosswords are 15x15 grids. Cells are shaded to denote breaks between <strong>lights</strong>, the different words and phrases in a grid. Every letter in an American-style crossword grid will be used or “checked” by both an Across and a Down light. This essentially means that there are no one-letter lights. There are typically no two-letter lights in an American-style grid, either. Furthermore, American-style grids typically have two-fold rotational symmetry (meaning you can rotate the grid 180° and the shaded cells will be in the same place).

<p>These puzzles are typically mistaken for crosswords. Note: See <a href="https://twitter.com/not_a_crossword?lang=en">@not_a_crossword</a> for more examples</p>

Each light is clued with a crossword clue, which can be written with different levels of difficulty. This is where a constructor can express their personality.

<h3>What is a meta-crossword?</h3>
<p>
A meta-crossword follows the conventions of a typical crossword puzzle but solves to a definitive final “answer.” The goal while solving a crossword is to simply fill out the grid. You’re finished once you have done that. In a meta crossword, there may be a few remaining steps you need to figure out in order to come up with a final answer. For example, the answer can be what is read across one of the main diagonals, or from certain highlighted cells. The step is typically hinted by the title.
</p>
<p>
Making a meta-crossword consists of few main steps: (1) Selecting an answer, (2) Coming up with a way to conceal that answer, (3) Constructing the grid, (4) Writing the crossword clues.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Things you will need</h3>
<p>At the bare minimum, you will need a workspace. This can be paper/pencil, Google Sheets, Microsoft Paint, anything. I recommend downloading <a href="https://www.quinapalus.com/qxw.html">Qxw</a>, a free crossword-writing program that will definitely help during a few steps of the writing process (See link for installation and setup instructions). I will also make references to Qxw’s commands and functions.
